- The background approach
- A list of similarities… that people generally assume are differences —> pier review, writing process, trying to get published
- Search out the grad students, they have more time —> find them in the abstract section of papers
- the importance of visualizations to explain complex scientific things
- jargon list
- Scientist to Journalist
  - this stuff is complicated you can’t simplify
- Journalist to Scientist
  - can you speak in human-readable terms?
  - which terms are really important here? where can we not afford to simplify?
